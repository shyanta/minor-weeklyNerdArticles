In this repository you can see my sketches from all the talks we had during this minor. The talks alle were very interesting and some very important people came by.

I wrote 5 articles about some of the topic that were discussed in the talks, or about a subject I thought it was worth to write an article about.

-   [Article 1: Why sketch noting is important for everyone, even the morons who can’t draw](/sketchNoting.md)
-   [Article 2: An introduction to git](/introductionToGit.md)
-   [Article 3: CSS-grid, why every browser should support it](/css-grid.md)
## #1 Stephan Hay (Catawiki) - Ux ?= FeD
Stephan Hay was the first talk we got. This was a Q&A. Student had very interesting questions and Stephan gave really good answers.

## #2 - Justus Sturkenboom (HvA) - Sketchnotes
Justus gave a talk about sketchnoting. Why it's important, how it works. And most important of all, he gave some tips on how to draw some things.

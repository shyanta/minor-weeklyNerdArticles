In this repository you can see my sketches from all the talks we had during this minor. The talks alle were very interesting and some very important people came by.

I wrote 5 articles about some of the topic that were discussed in the talks, or about a subject I thought it was worth to write an article about.

-   [Article 1: Why sketch noting is important for everyone, even the morons who can’t draw](/sketchNoting.md)
-   [Article 2: An introduction to git](/introductionToGit.md)
-   [Article 3: CSS-grid, why every browser should support it](/css-grid.md)
-   [Article 4: The history of Node JS](/nodejs.md)
-   [Article 5: Why your site has to be compatible with older browsers](/oldBrowsers.md)

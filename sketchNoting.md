# Why sketch noting is important for everyone, even the morons who can’t draw.

I can tell you first handed that I’m a very bad drawer. I mean, I try, I really do, but it’s just to god damn hard. And I believe that there are more people like me, people who think *“I’m a front-ender, why do I need to sketch”*. Give me a picture and I can redraw it reasonably, but tell me to draw a dog, without an example, I’m just the worst.

Now, in a college, my teacher Justus Sturkenboom explained why sketchnoting is really important. First, if you have a college, you want to write down your notes. You can either choose to write down a lot of text, or you can write down text with small drawings (or sketches). When you look back at your notes, I can tell you, it’s a lot more fun to watch the text with sketches, than the text without the sketches.

## What is sketching?
Visual notetaking is a creative way to take notes using pictures, typography, lines, shapes, and doodles, with marker-and-paper or stylus-and-tablet.<sup>1: blog.learningbird.com</sup>

## Why should you sketch note?
Like I said before, sketching has multiple pros. First, it really helps you to make your notes more personal, thus more interesting to look back to. Also sketching is a creative way to process a big amount of information. Instead of having to write it all down, you can draw it. Because you have to think about what you want to draw, you have to process the information, to be able to place it in one tiny sketch.

Also, there is a theory, that says the mind has two different parts where information is stored.
In one part, we store verbal representations and in the other we store mental images. This is why the combination of text and images is a great combination. You actually store these things twice, but in a different way.

One study by William E. Hockley (2008), found that “presenting items in pictorial form rather than as words not only benefits memory for the individual items, but also provides a memorial advantage for associations generated between random pairs of line drawings”.<sup>1: blog.learningbird.com</sup>

## How to: sketch noting
First, don’t tell me “I can’t draw”. Sketch noting is very simple. You have 5 simple basic shapes:
-	Square
-	Triangle
-	Circle
-	Lines
-	Dots

With these five shapes, you can create pretty much anything. As you can see in the image above. Along the way of trying to learn to sketch, you will find that some small sketches work for you. And once you found some sketches, you can use these all the time.
For me, I sort of found my way in traffic signs, so when something isn’t allowed, I use the stop or ‘one-way road’ sign.

So, what I’m trying to say here, sketch notes are very useful. You will remember the subject much better. And if you want to look back at something, it’s so much more fun to look at these sketches, to see what you made. And most of all, to see how you’ve grown in sketching, comparing your first notes to your last will crack you up.
So, if you feel like you’re a moron just like me, you will get there, don’t give up and keep on trying.

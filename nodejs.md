# The history of Node JS

NodeJS is really young. Though, NodeJS does have a big history, even if it only exists for 8 years. NodeJS has grown a lot and also, it’s used by a lot of people.
First, I’m going to tell you a little bit about NodeJS. After that, I’m going to let you in on the history of NodeJS and the big events that happened each year.

## What is NodeJS?
NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment. It executes JavaScript on the server-side. The biggest thing that NodeJS does, is running scripts before the content is loaded, to make the page content dynamic. The reason why this is perfect, is because it doesn’t matter on what browser you are. Because the JavaScript is rendered before the page is loaded. You can use all the JavaScript functions, you don’t have to worry about the support of a function in a browser. When you can use any function, your app will get a whole lot better.2: Wikipedia.org

Of course, this is just a list of some events. So, let’s take a look why you should use NodeJS.

## Why NodeJS should be used
NodeJS went through a lot the last couple of years. But all of those things, made NodeJS what it is today. Right now, NodeJS is very popular.

What I told you earlier, about NodeJS being server-sided JavaScript. Next to those facts, the other nice thing about NodeJS is that it works with templating. You can template in handlebars and in EJS (these are the most common). You can use one file, that will be rendered for multiple pages. You can send different data and based on that data the page will be rendered in a different way.<br/>
You can write conditionals inside these templates, let’s say you want to have a fall back when there is no data available. You can check with an if-statement if there is any data. If not, you can render a banner that says: “Play this game to see your data”. Of course, this is only one example of what you can do with these conditionals.

What I’m saying is, NodeJS is a very new language, but used for a lot of things. It’s fast-growing, and a lot of web bureaus are looking for developers who are familiar with NodeJS
